# Robustness Results

Here I discuss results pertaining to several exercises.

* no benchmark

* Use S&P 500 stocks (roughly 481stocks per month) as the benchmark rather than the CRSP universe (roughly 5000 stocks per month)[^1].

* Use quarter as an investment horizon rather than a month. 

[^1]:The number of stocks in my exercise is not necessarily 500, because my definition of inclusion in the exercise depends on whether a stock has appeared at least 17 times in a given month. In reality, some stocks are included in the S&P500 in the middle of a month and/or excluded from S&P 500 in the middle of the month, causing these stocks to have less than 17 appearances in a month.
