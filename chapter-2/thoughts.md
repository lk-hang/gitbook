## Empirical  Exercises:

- [ ] Repeat the optimization problem exercise without the benchmark weight.
- [ ] Robustness check for frequency: repeat the exercise with 3 months instead of 1 month
- [ ] Use S&P 500 as a benchmark instead of the CRSP.
- [ ] Use Tobit Model or similar censured model to characterize lambda as a function of observables, such as firm characteristics. For example, how do we categorize $$ \lambda = 1$$ stocks and $$ \lambda = 2$$ stocks? What are the firms with high $$ \lambda $$s, and what are the firms with low $$\lambda$$s? Merge CRSP with Compustat. What is the composition of risk: do some stocks tend to have high leverage/book/to/market? Which part could be assigned due to fundamentals, and which part due to non-fundamentals (trading cost/risk etc)?
- [ ] Double check why Alphas are so big for pre-formation portfolio.
- [ ] Post-Formation: Look whether price impact is present on the first few days. 

## Theoretical Exercises:

- [ ] Hypothesis development : do the results invalidate any longstanding hypothesis?
- [ ] Current result suggests evidence supporting Betting against beta and the failure of CAPM. Can we link the result to down-beta, downside-risk CAPM, for example? (Perhaps a sub-sample analysis will clarify some of these questions)
- [ ] Do the results suggest that (1) investing relative to benchmark leads to underperforming of the stocks, (2) stock return reversal or something else?
