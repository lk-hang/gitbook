# Speculative betas

Hong and Sraer 

<u>Research Question</u>: 

What explains the fact that long low-beta and short high-beta stocks can earn a positive return?

Their answer: two factors contribute to this puzzle. First, agents disagree on a common factor, namely cash flow. Second, short-sale constraints affect mispricing, particularly for high-beta stocks, which are more sensitive to speculations than low beta stocks. If agents disagree over the cash flow, then agents who are more pessimistic would want to short-sell high-beta stocks in an unconstrained world. Due to short-sale constraints, however, pessimistic agents would want to short-sale these stocks, resulting in that these stocks are overpriced (prices are ultimately only reflecting the views of the optimists, and pessimist that want to short cannot do so)

## Model

Here I will discuss the implications and setup of the static model only. The paper also discusses the dynamic results but the implications are more or less the same.

* Time periods $$ t = 0 $$
* There are different types of agents:
